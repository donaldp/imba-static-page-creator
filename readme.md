Use imba to create regular static html pages.

`/src/build.imba` writes html and css files to `/dist/` which can be opened as static html pages. To run the build you can use `npm run build` To serve those pages (to make sure they work) you can use `npm run serve-static`

For development (with hot reloading) the `/src/server.imba` file is used, you can run the development server with `npm run dev`.
